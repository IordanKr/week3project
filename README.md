Coursera Week 3 Course Project

The script uses the features.txt as the variables that were looked into.
It merges the activity column ("y_test", "y_train") with the observations for each Subject.

It merges the test and training subjects in one dataset, labels the activities by changing the numbers for the specific activity 
that was analyzed and maintains only the variables looking into means or standard deviations, no mean frequencies.
